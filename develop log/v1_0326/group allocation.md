## `2022/3/26` Group meeting

Today we had a routine group online meeting, where we discussed the first iteration’s work allocation. From the prototype we made last week, the user interface was our first priority. Hence, we allocated the everyone’s work based on the part of the prototype(10 parts included). The detail is listed below.
