\chapter{About the Template}
%\label{chapter:title}

This template aims to simplify and improve the (Xe)LaTeX report template by Delft University of Technology. Some of the main features:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Simplicity First:} A class file that has been reduced by nearly 70\% to simplify customization;
  \item \textbf{Effortless:} A careful selection of common packages to get started immediately;
  \item \textbf{Complete:} Ready-to-go when it comes to the document and file structure.
\end{itemize}
